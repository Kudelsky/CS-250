All questions are weaved together to answer all threre questions:

   #1 How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   #2 How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   #3 What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Answer: Interpreting what users want and turning that into working programs takes more than just coding skills. It’s about truly hearing what people are aiming for and shaping those goals into features that make sense in their lives. Writing user stories helps a lot here. These stories let you see things from their side so your programs aren’t just technical checkboxes but tools that matter to someone’s day.
When building something, first thing I do is to break down what’s being asked. I design in small pieces, fixing and reshaping as I go along. Listening to feedback becomes part of the design itself, not a step at the end. For my next projects, planning to stick with Agile ways of working like Scrum and user story mapping. Keeps everything flexible. Helps me stay close to what people actually need.
And being a solid teammate in software development isn’t just about delivering code. It’s working together, sharing ideas openly, helping each other out when things get tangled. Respect matters. Different views often lead to stronger solutions. Everyone feeling safe to speak up makes the work better and more reliable and builds programs that really work for those who use them.
